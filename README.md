# Exam: INF-3910 Blockchain

## Install pre-requisites for developing

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK 2.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
* [FAKE 5](https://fake.build/) installed as a [global tool](https://fake.build/fake-gettingstarted.html#Install-FAKE)
* The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager (you an also use `npm` but the usage of `yarn` is encouraged).
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components.
* If you're running on OSX or Linux, you'll also need to install [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

## Docker images

To build a Docker image from source:

```sh
docker build -t blockchain .
```

## Developing the application

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
mono .paket/paket.exe install
yarn install
dotnet restore
fake build -t Run
```


## SAFE Stack Documentation

You will find more documentation about the used F# components at the following places:

* [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md)
* [Fable](https://fable.io/docs/)
* [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/)

If you want to know more about the full Azure Stack and all of it's components (including Azure) visit the official [SAFE documentation](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/).

## Troubleshooting

* **fake not found** - If you fail to execute `fake` from command line after installing it as a global tool, you might need to add it to your `PATH` manually: (e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet/tools:$PATH"` on unix) - [related GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/9321)
